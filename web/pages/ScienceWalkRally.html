<p class="lead">We have 5 zones in science walk rally activities (Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Mathematics and Robotic technology). Prior to TJSSF2018 arrival, students will select to join the activity from these zones in a package which includes only 3 zones.
</p>
<p class="lead">Students have to register for one package selection to join the activity on 8 June 2018. Register system (online) is closing on 16 May 2018 within 9.00 pm, after that the staff will set the package for students who miss the registration.</p>

 <h4 class="text-success"><strong>Magic Square (Mathematics)</strong></h4>
 <p class="lead">Normally, a magic square is a n x n square grid (where n is the number of cells on each side) that contains equal number of cells in column and row.</p>
  <p class="lead">Within each cell, there is a distinct number that is not repeated to numbers in other cells such that the sum of all numbers in each column, row and diagonal has the same value. This sum is called “magic constant” of the magic square.</p>
     <p class="lead">The magic square of order n is an arrangement of n2 numbers, usually distinct integers, in a square. The example of magic square of order 3 is as follows:
</p>

<div class="col-lg-5 col-sm-5">
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="lead">It can be seen that:
	The sum of numbers on each row is 8+1+6 = 15, 3+5+7 = 15
							and 4+9+2 = 15.</p>
	<p class="lead">The sum of numbers on each column is 8+3+4 = 15, 1+5+9 = 15
 							and 6+7+2 = 15.</p>
	<p class="lead">The sum of numbers on each diagonal is 8+5+2 = 15, 4+5+6 = 15.
Therefore, the magic constant of this square table is 15.</p>
<p class = "lead">All of these is a normal magic square but in this Mathematics zone, non-normal magic square will be done. The main task of this activity therefore is to find the magic constant for non-normal magic square. It is another fun way of learning the concepts of number, an operations in algebra, and to practice solving new problems through the magic square game.

 <p class="lead">Chemical Powered Car</p>
  <p class="lead">Chemical reactions produce phase changes (gases, liquids, and solids) that can make a car drive. Several factors affect how far the car can go. In this session, students will be challenged to apply the principles of stoichiometry, changes in chemical reactions and engineering design to make the car go the farthest. Students will design a car that is powered solely by a chemical reaction and can travel the farthest.</p>

 <p class="lead">Forensic Science Investigation</p>
  <p class="lead">The popularity of such shows as CSI or Bones has increased interest in forensic science and its applications for many students. The activity is an inquiry that students will investigate about fingerprinting, chemical analyses and blood spatter. The resulting information can be used to solve a crime and determine the guilty suspect. </p>
